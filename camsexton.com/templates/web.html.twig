	I create websites. Here are some examples of sites I've made for Australian artists. 
	<br>
	All my ARTIST sites are quick to build, competitively priced and include the schedule feature.
	<br>
	The SCHEDULE feature:
	<br>
	Easily update YOUR WEBSITE gig list or public schedule by simply entering an event into a google calendar.
	<br>
	NO messing with code or logging into confusing, bulky website-managers. You can even do it from YOUR PHONE using Google Calendar.
