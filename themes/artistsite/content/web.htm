	Easy Websites for Busy Artists

Musicians, artists, performers... we all know we need a website. 
<br>
Just a simple one is fine, right?
<br>
All you need is a bio, some examples of your work, contact details... and your upcoming schedule.

For a long time, maintaining the gig list on my band's website was constantly frustrating. I neglected logging into the admin area frequently enough to keep it current - and inevitably it was always out of date. I've seen so many other websites too with events listed that were months, even years old!

<div class="item">
Cam Sexton's Artist Websites solve this problem.

<h3><i>Killer Feature #1:</i></h3>
<p style="width: 100%">
The schedule page (like the one on this site) syncs with a Google Calendar, making it quick and easy to update from your laptop or phone in the same calendar app you probably already use to stay organised. So when you confirm an event and put it in your calendar, your website <i>automagically</i> updates with the details. And once an event has passed, it is instantly removed. A typical entry includes:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: top">
<div style="display: inline-block; width: 50%;">
<ul style="padding: 20px; display: inline-block; width: 100%">
	<li>Gig Title</li>
	<li>Time/Date</li>
	<li>Venue (links to Google Maps)</li>
	<li>Optional description with further details</li>
</ul>
