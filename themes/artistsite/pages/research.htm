			This thesis documents the background and concepts underpinning the digital musical instrument, Electric Sheep Texture Synthesizer. Many computer-based synthesizers are compromised by a lack of adequate real-time control solutions that limits their versatility in live performance. Research into controller mapping techniques that address this issue has led to the design of this performance-focused instrument and a recorded folio of creative works demonstrating its use. Frameworks to build sophisticated mapping architectures are discussed in order to construct a model for performance-focused mapping design, and a formula for expressivity is proposed. Three mapping systems of varying complexity were developed for Electric Sheep and here they are compared and evaluated for expressivity in live performance.
